<p>As you may or may not know, I briefly ran a blog for a few months about a year ago.
Although it was a lot of fun, I eventually ran out of ideas and motivation to keep writing new posts, especially considering the process that had to go formatting and publishing them.
I have decided to restart my blog from scratch using a new workflow that allows for even more power to go into these posts.
I am using a combination of R Studio and Hugo to create these pages in R Markdown files, making citations much easier and even allowing for R code blocks to be used.
Hopefully this gives me some more room to write about whatever I feel like writing about.
Take a look at this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stat &lt;- data.frame(c(1, 5, 100))
summary(stat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   c.1..5..100.   
##  Min.   :  1.00  
##  1st Qu.:  3.00  
##  Median :  5.00  
##  Mean   : 35.33  
##  3rd Qu.: 52.50  
##  Max.   :100.00</code></pre>
<p>Here I just centered some numbers into a series and them found their summary statistics, but I’m sure you can imagine how much can be done with this type of thing.
In any case, this is it for the first post (and hopefully not the last).</p>
