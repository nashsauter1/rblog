> **"A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth" ~Joseph Poore, Climate Researcher**

Concern about the threat of climate change is at an all-time high across many parts of the world. In Pew Research's Spring 2022 Global Attributes Survey, climate change ranked as the top concern among citizens of nineteen countries. A median of 75% of the citizens even labeled global climate change as a major threat, with only 5% believing that it's no threat at all {{< cite "atske2022">}}.
Of course, there's good reason to believe that these fears are warranted. The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change displays how the lives of millions of people have already been altered by climate change and how the impacts will only continue to get worse without immediate and drastic change.
Even if we contained warming to 1.5° C from pre-industrial temperatures, we could expect to see a four-fold increase in extreme weather events from 2020 to 2100.
Further problems include deadly heat stress, rising sea levels, water scarcity, food shortages, among countless other issues {{< cite "ipcc2022">}} [^IPCC].

As we continue to gain knowledge about the risks of climate change, it's natural to wonder what we can do about this seemingly gargantuan obstacle.
Activist groups have done a great job educating the general-public about solutions relating to renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure, and over-consumption. However, one of the greatest steps we can take starts with the food on our plates. The seemingly inconsequential choices we make in order to feed ourselves on a daily basis have wide-reaching effects on the environment.
More specifically, the animal agriculture industry is a major player in the acceleration of climate change and environmental damage. By foregoing meat, dairy, eggs, and other animal products in favor of a plant-based diet, we could take a significant step towards a sustainable future [^Target].

# The Effect of Food Systems

Since everyone on Earth needs food to survive, it's only natural that an increasing global population will result in an increasing need for food production.
The current world population is around 8 billion people, and current estimates suggest we can expect that to rise to about 9.7 billion people by the year 2050 {{< cite "undes2022">}}. Although the rate of population growth is starting to slow down, that doesn't make adjusting to our new population levels any less of a challenge.
One issue at hand is a growing demand for crop calories and protein from richer nations. Agricultural and population data ranging from 1961 to 2007 suggests that there's a consistent relationship between the per capita GDP of a nation and their per capita demand for crop calories and protein.
This relationship seems to be especially strong; it's held up between nations in similar economic standings and across all years in the sample. In the year 2000, for example, per capita demand for crop calories was 256% higher in the wealthiest nations compared to the poorest nations [^Tilman].
By these metrics, we can expect a roughly 100% increase in global crop calorie demand between 2005 and 2050 {{< cite "tilman2011" 20260 >}}.

Along with the issues that we can expect in the future, our global food systems as they exist today are already major contributors to the climate crisis.
Using data from a recent database of the greenhouse gas emissions from food from 1990-2015, we can estimate that around 34% of the total anthropogenic GHG emissions on Earth are caused by the global food system {{< cite "crippa2021" 198 >}}.
These emission levels are putting us at risk of not being able to meet the 1.5° or 2° C global temperature increase limits that are recommended by the Paris Agreement.
The authors of a 2020 analysis published in the *Science* journal found that even if we were to see a rapid reduction in fossil fuel emissions, global food system emissions are on a trajectory that would still cause us to hit those limits:

> "Our estimate of cumulative business-as-usual food system emissions from 2020 to 2100 is 1356 Gt CO2-we. As such, even if all non–food system GHG emissions were immediately stopped and were net zero from 2020 to 2100, emissions from the food system alone would likely exceed the 1.5°C emissions limit between 2051 and 2063. Further, given our estimate of food system emissions, maintaining a 67% chance of meeting the 2°C target would require keeping cumulative nonfood emissions to \<50 Gt CO2-we in total over the next 80 years. This is slightly more than 1 year of current GHG emissions from non–food system activities {{< cite "clark2020" 2>}}."

## Non-Emission Environmental Impacts

Although greenhouse gases are naturally one of the top concerns relating to the protection of our environment, it's not the only concern worth investigating.
Other issues such as land use, water use, terrestrial acidification, eutrophication [^Eutro], and other types of localized pollution also have widely varying impacts from different food sources that will force us to evaluate our dietary choices.
One analysis of these issues from 2018 compiled data through a comprehensive meta-analysis of 1530 studies, creating a data set that covers around 38,700 farms in 119 countries and 40 individual food products representing ~90% of global protein and calorie consumption.
The authors, Joseph Poore with the University of Oxford and Thomas Nemecek with the Switzerland-based LCA Research Group, found that global food production causes 32% of terrestrial acidification, 78% of eutrophication, 43% of non-ice and non-desert land use, and 90-95% of freshwater use when weighted for water-scarcity {{< cite "poore2018" 1>}}.
Unsurprisingly, the majority of these harmful environmental effects can be attributed to animal agriculture as opposed to entirely plant-based processes.
It's estimated that if the world were to entirely replace all dietary animal products with plant-based alternatives, we could reduce land use by 76%, terrestrial acidification by 50%, eutrophication by 49%, and freshwater use by 19%.
These changes would be especially noticeable in the United States where average meat consumption per person is three times higher than the rest of the world {{< cite "poore2018" 5>}}.


## Deforestation

Furthermore, although deforestation for plant-based agriculture tends to be a hotly contested topic, it's worth looking deeper into what's being grown in these areas and for what purposes.
Poore and Nemecek's 2018 study found that this problem is controlled by a specific type of agriculture: animal feed.
In fact, 67% of the agriculture-related deforestation is either for the growth of plants such as soy or maize which are then used for feeding farmed animals, or is directly used for pasture {{< cite "poore2018" 5>}}.
For example, data from the University of Oxford's Food Climate Research Network shows that around 75% of soy is fed to livestock.
Only 20% of soy is actually processed for human consumption through oils or foods such as edamame, soy milk, tempeh, and tofu {{< cite "fraanje2020" 8>}}.
Furthermore, a separate analysis examined what kinds of food-systems changes would be necessary to meet the demand for food globally if we were to have a world without any amount of deforestation.
Out of various scenarios involving different crop yields, feed types, organic processes, and livestock sources, only 18% of western industrial diets and 50% of healthy meat-based diets were found to be feasible.
In comparison, 100% of plant-based scenarios were found to be feasible  
{{< cite "theurl2020" 5>}}.

# Food Waste and Energy Efficiency

One of the questions that arises whenever anyone advocates for a plant-based food system is pretty obvious: how are we going to feed everyone?
After all, meat, dairy, eggs, and other animal products have been turned into staples of Western diets.
Interestingly, it turns out that it would actually be *easier* to produce enough food to feed everyone under a plant-based food system compared to the status quo.
While much of the debate regarding global hunger centers around how to prevent the large amounts of food that gets wasted, the importance of dietary change is largely overlooked.

Retail-to-consumer food loss in the United States tends to hover around 30% for vegetables and 40% for meat due to factors like spoilage and supply chain issues.
Reducing these losses, such as by investing in better ways to keep food fresh for longer, is certainly important if we want to reduce hunger and increase our sustainability.
However, solely looking at this number would ignore the more nuanced concept of "opportunity food loss".
Animal food sources require more resources to create than plant food sources, meaning that there are many opportunities to replace foods with more efficient alternatives.
A study from *Shepon et al.* in 2018 demonstrated just how important these differences can be:

> "We find that the opportunity food losses at the consumer level range from 40% for eggs to 96% for beef (the most and least efficient animal food categories). Put differently, nutritionally comparable plant-based diets optimized to nutritionally replace eggs and beef produce twofold and 20-fold more protein per acre than the eggs and beef they replace\
> {{< cite "shepon2018" 3805>}}."

Simply put, even the most nutritionally-efficient animal products (eggs) cause a 40% loss of potential nutrients.
In the worst cases, as with beef, choosing to produce the animal-based product over plant-based alternatives is functionally equivalent to throwing away 96% of our protein supply!
More practically speaking, if we were to replace all animal-based products in the United States (based on the average American diet), we would be able to feed an additional **350 million** people {{< cite "shepon2018" 3806>}}.
To bring that to a smaller scale, just two Americans choosing to switch to a fully plant-based diet would free up enough resources for an extra person to be completely fed without using any extra resources.

# Are There Any Alternatives?
Even if one is to believe that animal agriculture is currently unsustainable, it could still be possible that it could eventually become sustainable some time in the future.
Or alternatively, one could argue that the types of foods people are eating aren't even the biggest environmental problems to be found in our global food systems.
That's why it's important to consider the various different approaches that we could take towards fixing these systems.
Here I'll be exploring some of the most common concerns and problems that people have regarding food-related environmental impacts.

## Sustainable Animal Agriculture
One natural concern is that it doesn't seem to make sense to lump all the animal-based products and all the plant-based products into two distinct piles when there are countless foods in each group.
After all, there are varying levels of emissions based on the individual products that consumers choose to buy within each group.
Maybe if we could just focus on producing animal products in a more sustainable way, then the gap in environmental effects between the two groups could close.
There are a few main problems with this approach.

First, the trends that we see of animal products having higher impacts than plant products tend to be very consistent.
For example, if we specifically look at the animal products that have the *lowest* impacts, they still tend to have higher emissions, eutrophication, acidification, and land-use than the average substitute vegetable proteins.
There are a few main reasons for this.
First, more protein (and therefore more transportation emissions) have to go into the growth of an animal and its byproducts than the amount of edible protein that comes out.
Second, animals naturally create additional emissions due to their biological processes.
Third, more emissions are added from the processing of live animals, particularly from when they're processed through slaughterhouses.
Finally, animal products tend to spoil faster, meaning that more energy needs to go into preventing waste  
{{< cite "poore2018" 4-5>}}.

Beyond the differences between food products, there are also differences in emissions between individual producers.
Across all types of foods, a large amount of emissions can be attributed to relatively high-impact producers.
On average 56% of the environmental impacts will come from the top 25% of producers with the highest impacts {{< cite "-poore2018" 2>}}.
Although there are mechanisms that could help to address this, there are of course several significant barriers.
Primarily, the actions that would be best for reducing emissions for each producer are vastly different based on geographic conditions and economic feasibility.
Since there are so many sources of emissions and other environmental impacts, it wouldn't make sense to just focus on a few of them on a global scale {{< cite "-poore2018" 3>}}.
There's also the obvious issue that consumers could just continue purchasing from the highest impact farms.
Despite efforts to label and certify sustainable palm oil sources, there was found to be virtually no demand for the certified products in important markets such as China and India.
The case of organic foods also demonstrates how consumers aren't always willing to pay a higher price in order to buy a more sustainable product.
This means that food producers can end up with little incentive to increase the sustainability of their processes {{< cite "-poore2018" 4>}}.

## Buying Local
Another common motto among the environmentally conscious is the phrase "buy local!"
But when it comes to food, is buying from local producers actually a good way to reduce one's environmental impact?

- Transportation as a whole represents only 11% of life-cycle GHG emissions, and final delivery from producer to retail contributes only 4%” (Weber and Matthews, 2008, p. 1)
- “Shifting less than one day per week’s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken, fish, eggs, or a vegetable-based diet achieves more GHG reduction than buying all locally sourced food.” ([Weber and Matthews, 2008, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/82NNKYPR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8GS66P4M?page=1&annotation=KSI3CWR5))
- “Importation of Spanish field-grown lettuce into the UK during winter produced fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than lettuce produced in UK-protected systems at that time” ([Hospido et al., 2009, p. 381](zotero://select/library/items/6IB33HPG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HYCGCY74?page=1&annotation=HPH2VRNS))
